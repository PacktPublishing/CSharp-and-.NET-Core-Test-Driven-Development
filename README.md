# C# and .NET Core Test-Driven Development
This is the code repository for [C# and .NET Core Test-Driven Development](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/c-7-test-driven-development?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788292481), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book guides developers to create robust, production-ready C# 7 and .NET Core applications through the practice of test-driven development process.

In C# and .NET Core Test-Driven Development, you will learn the different stages of the TDD life cycle, basics of TDD, best practices, and anti-patterns. It will teach you how to create an ASP.NET Core MVC sample application, write testable code with SOLID principles and set up a dependency injection for your sample application. Next, you will learn the xUnit testing framework and learn how to use its attributes and assertions. Youâ€™ll see how to create data-driven unit tests and mock dependencies in your code. You will understand the difference between running and debugging your tests on .NET Core on LINUX versus Windows and Visual Studio. As you move forward, you will be able to create a healthy continuous integration process for your sample application using GitHub, TeamCity, Cake, and Microsoft VSTS.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All chapters have the code, placed in the respective folder.

The code will look like the following:
```
[Fact]
public void Test_IsServerOnline_ShouldReturnTrue()
{
bool isOnline=IsServerOnline();
Assert.True(isOnline);
}
```

C# programming and working knowledge of Microsoft Visual Studio is assumed.
